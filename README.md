# Jasmin SMS GUI

A [Py4web](https://py4web.com/) GUI application for managing and monitoring all aspects of a a single instance of the popular open source [Jasmin SMS Gateway](https://github.com/jookies/jasmin) as an alternative to the standard jcli command line interface.

## Interface features

* Responsive layout built with Bulma and Bootstrap
* Toggleable dark/light theme (use the icon in the navigation bar)
* Card style dashboard with updated icons and modern fonts

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the relevant deployment documentaion for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. Installation and setup will vary depending on your operating system and preferred installation method and are covered in great detail in the respective documentation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* A working installation of the Jasmin SMS Gateway software with standard jcli port exposed (can be a docker container) 
* A working Py4Web installation (either dev or live deployment) which can access jcli port on Jasmin either locally or remotely

### Installing

Depending on your requirements and OS installation will vary.

Full documentation for the installation and usage for Jasmin SMS Gateway can be found at https://docs.jasminsms.com/en/latest/index.html 

Full documentation for the installation and usage for Py4Web can be found at https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/index.html

Example:
To set up a development environment on a Windows 10 machine with WSL2 (Ubuntu) and a dockerised Jasmin follow these steps: 


```
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.28.5, build c4eb3a1f
```
If docker is not installed you will need to install it before proceeding

Create a directory of your choice to store your docker-compose file

```
$ mkdir /opt/scripts/jasmin
$ cd /opt/scripts/jasmin
```

Create a docker compose file in the directory usind your favourite editor

```
$ vi docker-compose.yml
```
Paste the following into the docker-compose.yml

```
version: "3"

services:
  smppsim:
    image: eagafonov/smppsim
    container_name: smppsim
    ports:
      - 3785:2775
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    restart: unless-stopped

  rabbit-mq:
    image: rabbitmq:alpine
    restart: unless-stopped

  jasmin:
    image: jookies/jasmin:0.10
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: jasmin
    volumes:
      - /var/log/jasmin:/var/log/jasmin
      #- /etc/jasmin:/etc/jasmin
      - /etc/jasmin/store:/etc/jasmin/store

    ports:
      - 2775:2775
      - 8990:8990
      - 1401:1401
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - rabbit-mq
    environment:
      REDIS_CLIENT_HOST: redis
      AMQP_BROKER_HOST: rabbit-mq
      SMPPSIM: smppsim
```

This includes an smpp simulator in order to test connectivity etc.
Save and close.

Start the Jasmin container
```
$ docker-compose up
```
Check that Jasmin and dependancies are up and running
```
$ docker ps

```
Please refer to the Jasmin manual for troubleshooting if needed 

Create a python3 virtual environment in the location of your choice or follow py4web installation procedures for deployment
```
$ cd /opt
$ python3 -m venv py4web
```
Activate the virtual environment
```
$ source py4web/bin/activate
(py4web)$
```
Install Py4Web in the newly created virtual environment
```
(py4web)$ cd py4web
(py4web)$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade py4web --no-cache-dir
```
Hint: If python3 doesnt work try using just pyhon instead.
This will install py4web and all its dependencies on the system’s path only. The assets folder (that contains the py4web’s system apps) will also be created. After the installation you’ll be able to start py4web on any given working folder with
```
py4web setup apps
py4web set_password
py4web run apps
```
## First Run
```
$ py4web run apps
```
Once py4web is running you can access a specific app at the following urls from your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000
http://localhost:8000/_dashboard
http://localhost:8000/{yourappname}/index
```
In order to stop py4web, you need to hit Control-C on the window where you run it.
Please refer to the user documentation if you need to change the configs or wish to use different ports etc.

## Check Jasmin Configuration
Depending on how Jasmin has been installed the following steps should be taken at this stage:

``` 
telnet <jcli host> <jcli port> 
$ telnet 0.0.0.0 8990
username:
```
If you see the username: prompt Jasmin is configured correctly and we can proceed to install the GUI

## Install the application

Now that we have both Jasmin and Py4web configured and running we need to install the Jasmin SMS GUI. This is a Py4Web app so should go in the py4web/apps folder.

```
cd apps
git clone https://github.com/Eudorajab1/jasmin_smsc_gui.git .
```

Once you have cloned the app you need open the file apps/jasmin_smsc_gui/settings.py in your favourite text edior and change the following:

* JASMIN_HOST host as per telnet command
* JASMIN_PORT port as per telnet command
* JASMIN_USER as per jasmin config default is "jcliuser"
* JASMIN_PWD  as per jasmin config default is "jclipwd"

to reflect your setup.

Once saved you can restart Py4Web and navigate to http://localhost:8000/jasmin_smsc_gui

## Initialize the database
If you have an existing instance of Jasmin, once you have connected you can run the populate database function from the superadmin option which will import all current groups, users, connectors, filters etc from your working instance of Jasmin.
